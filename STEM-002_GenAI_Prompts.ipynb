    "**Generative artificial intelligence** (generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating original content in various forms, such as text, images, videos, or even software code.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ These systems operate using generative models, which learn patterns and structures from their input training data and then generate new data with similar characteristics. The advancements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs).\n",
    "+ Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. In other words, a prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.\n",
    "+ Understanding how to make a prompt work for you is an important skill.\n",
