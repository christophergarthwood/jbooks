Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).\n","\n","For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is s binary classification since there are only 2 classes as spam and not spam. A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class. In this case, known spam and non-spam emails have to be used as the training data. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect an unknown email.\n","\n","Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets also provided with the input data. There are many applications in classification in many domains such as in credit approval, medical diagnosis, target marketing etc.\n","\n","Reference: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification\n","\n","Reference: https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-classifiers-a5cc4e1b0623"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Environment Check"],"metadata":{"id":"Zramkw-P93C-"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"shY7a4DVQjWB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716241334117,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":163,"user":{"displayName":"Christopher Wood","userId":"16771371824085474335"}},"outputId":"729555dd-7544-48ed-ce7d-53a2544c7f13"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["You are running this notebook in Google Colab.\n"]}],"source":["# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n","#- Google Colab Check\n","# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n","RunningInCOLAB = False\n","RunningInCOLAB = 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython())\n","\n","if RunningInCOLAB:\n","    print(\"You are running this notebook in Google Colab.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"You are running this notebook with Jupyter iPython runtime.\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"nO_Hq5eq9joH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["############################################\n","# INCLUDES\n","############################################\n","#libraries specific to this example\n","## Imports\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","\n","import glob\n","import imageio\n","import matplotlib as matplt\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import PIL\n","import time\n","\n","from IPython import display\n","\n","#a set of libraries that perhaps should always be in Python source\n","import os\n","import datetime\n","import sys\n","import gc\n","import getopt\n","import inspect\n","import math\n","import warnings\n","\n","#a darn useful library for creating paths and one I recommend you load to your environment\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","from pydoc import help                          #
